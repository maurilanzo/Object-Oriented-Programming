Extended Persistence-Based [Conway’s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

This project is part of the final exam of the third year course of Object Oriented Programming, it expands the classic Game of Life with new biological behaviors, energy dynamics, and persistent simulation. Cells gain individuality through types and moods that affect how they survive, interact, and evolve. The environment influences cells through energy exchange and global events that can transform the entire board in a single generation.

The simulation runs across generations, tracking every change and storing it through a persistent JPA/Hibernate layer backed by an in-memory H2 database. The system allows analysis, visualization, and replay of evolving configurations, offering a richer and more dynamic interpretation of Conway’s original idea.
